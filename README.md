## Introduction

### American Sign Language

American Sign Language (ASL) serves as the main sign language of the deaf community in North America. In the language, words and grammar are composed of a combination of hand signals and facial expressions to convey sentences. However, for words without a sign, such as names and loanwords, there exists ASL fingerspelling, where English letters can be individually represented with a hand sign.

For learners of ASL, it may be difficult to find someone from the deaf community to interact with. As such, it is often a challenge receiving adequate practice and feedback, even for something as simple as fingerspelling.

### Project Objective

The Sign Language Alphabet Translator (SLAT) uses machine learning classification algorithms to translate and identify a learner's fingerspelling signs live as it is shown to the computer camera.

## Usage

### Environment Setup

This project requires:
- Python 3.10
- Package manager `poetry`

To install `poetry`, run:

```sh
$ pip install poetry
```

### Running the Program

1. Run `make init` to initialize the project by downloading all dependencies.
2. Run `make start` to start the app.
